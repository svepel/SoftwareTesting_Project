## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- I learn the basics of the test cases structure and how to implement the manual testings.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
- I used the template provided and used logical thinking when writing the test cases
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management, 
 - In order to keep the test cases in order and easier to track the managment software such as Jira would work the best.    


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Code as it support many languages and it has intigration with GitHub


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- No troubles. It was cleary listed what to do and templates helped a lot.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I used GitHub for other courses in university. So had previous experience. Did not face any problems.
 

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would use Robot Framework. As it is one of the most popolar framework in Finland nowadays and easy to use.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

- Relevant educational background
- Basic IT, analytical and systems skills with the ability to coordinate and communicate
- Skills/Interest on Test automation (e.g. with Jenkins and Robot Framework or Cucumber, â€¦)
- Good knowledge and experience on using Linux (basic commands, using text editors, shell scripting)
- Knowledge in tools like Splunk, Jira, qTest
- Experience with software development projects and basic use of the Linux operating system
- Good teamwork skills and self-direction
- Good Communication and collaboration skills
- Fluent spoken and written English
- Ability and willingness to learn to gain knowledge and develop skills


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Lerning Robot Framework, basic skills with Linux, more experience with Jira


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- The theoretacal part was very deep versus to the practical part. The theory can be shorten but learning the automation testing tools added to the unit. Would be nice to include some part of the Robot Framework to the study and make the project using automatical tests using the Framework. This way it is more work related and benificial. Also real case senarios of the testing the real developing software product would be intresting and benificial.
