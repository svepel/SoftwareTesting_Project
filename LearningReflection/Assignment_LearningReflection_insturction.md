### What is Learning reflection
The learning reflection is a  document, which reflects the evolution of your learning process. It is an individual writing document, that includes reporting on your thinking and personal reflections from your project work, readings, and course activities. It is not advisable to "just answer the questions", but rather construct your answer so that you cover the questions. 

### Why you need to write the learning reflection
